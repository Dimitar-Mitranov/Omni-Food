      I want to go outside and dance in the rain, to feel the sting and the
      pain, because you see I'm insane, I would jump in front of a train, just
      to step up my game, If I see you and I kill you, you'll be to blame. I
      always drive in the fast lane, jump off an airplane, adrenaline ghostmane.
